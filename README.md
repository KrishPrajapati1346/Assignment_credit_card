the phone+otp login and register is hardcoded 
but can be changed to generate unique users for each phone number and issue a JWT token for them instead of using the mock phone token

email+ pwd and gmail login works perfectly and the parsed statements also appear in the profile on connecting the appropriate gmail 
for now as it is in testing only the authorized gmail and its statements can only be displayed which is provided in the screenhshots 

and it also has the functionality that if the user has logged in before the user gets directly to the profile and can directly find the bank statements there just with a click
